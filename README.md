# Introduction

This documentation will help you understand how the Wallet works and how you can use it. However, it presumes a certain level of knowledge about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so

* if you are already familiar with SSI, you can jump to the [introduction of the Wallet](wallet-kit/wallet/).
* if you are new to SSI, please continue with our [introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity](wallet-kit/self-sovereign-identity/).
